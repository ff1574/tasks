# Workspace Tasks

This workspace contains three tasks, each in its own subfolder. Here's a brief overview of each task:

## [Task 1: Polygon Map Display](task1/README.md)

This task involves creating a web application that displays a map with a polygon overlay using OpenLayers. The application fetches polygon data from a JSON file and displays it on the map. The map is styled using a CSS file and the application logic is written in JavaScript.

**Main files:** [index.html](task1/index.html), [css/main.css](task1/css/main.css), [scripts/app.js](task1/scripts/app.js), [data/polygon.json](task1/data/polygon.json)

**Usage:** Open the project in Visual Studio Code, right-click on the index.html file in the explorer panel, and select Open with Live Server from the context menu. The application will open in your default web browser.

## [Task 2: Python API w/ Flask - Unauthorized Sales Detection](task2/README.md)

This task involves creating a Flask application that exposes a POST endpoint at `/detect_unauthorized_sales`. This endpoint is designed to identify unauthorized sales transactions by comparing product listings with actual sales records.

**Main file:** [main.py](task2/main.py)

**Usage:** Run the script using a Python interpreter. The Flask application will start and listen for incoming connections.

## [Task 3: Python API w/ Flask - Max Non-Overlapping Job Interviews](task3/README.md)

This task involves creating a Flask application that exposes a POST endpoint at `/max_interviews`. This endpoint is designed to calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping job interviews a person can attend.

**Main file:** [main.py](task3/main.py)

**Usage:** Run the script using a Python interpreter. The Flask application will start and listen for incoming connections.
